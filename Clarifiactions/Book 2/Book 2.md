# List Book 2

## List 3-Classical Indian

For Mauryas the Irr Bge(S) cannot be upgraded to regular (historical, see DBMM message 94433), but this does not prevent the rest of the baggage from being upgraded to regular.

Cv(S) and El generals count towards the number of El or Cv(S) for the purposes of the total number of re-grades allowed as WWg(I) or Kn(I).

Bw used when El(O) are upgraded to El(S) are still removed from the Bw minimum \*even\* when the El(S) are re-graded as WWg(I).
