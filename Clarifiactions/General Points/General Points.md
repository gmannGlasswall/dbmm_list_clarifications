# General issues

This section lists common list issues applicable to many army lists.


## Upgrading Generals for Allied contingents

Where an upgrade is of the form &quot;C-in-C and …&quot; it can be used for an allied contingent, but the allied general must be one of those upgraded.

 
## Nationality-Restricted Troops in Allied Contingents

In general allied contingents have a nationality specified in the list that includes them, e.g. Volsci in &quot;Volsci allies - List: Italian Hill Tribes (Bk 1/36)&quot;. Allied contingents can include troops that are only allowed in the main list if the C-in-C is of a certain nationality - as long as the allied general is of the nationality in question and the troops are compulsory or otherwise allowed to allied contingents by list notes. In the case where no specific nationality or sub-list is given for allied contingents then any nationality or sub-list that matches the theatre and date of the main list may be used.

Where an internal ally has restrictions on what troops they can command, e.g. Turkoman generals in the Seljuk Turk list, they can also command baggage from their list. The baggage they are commanding being assumed to be of that origin. (However allies in sub-lists may not be able to have baggage, see below.)

 
## Allied Contingents

Unless otherwise specified in the list:

1. An external ally-general may not command elements from the main list being used, i.e it may only command element from the allies list.
2. Elements from an external allied contingent may not be commanded by generals from the main list.
3. If the allied contingent can contribute to the army baggage then other suitable foot or train elements from the allied contingent can be placed in the army baggage command.
4. Unless otherwise stated troops listed in the form &quot;0, or X-Y&quot; may be included in included in foreign contingents. If any are taken then any internal allied contingents must include ¼ of these.


## Ally Date Ranges

&quot;_Unless otherwise specified by either of the 2 lists, allied troops cannot be used outside their own army&#39;s date range, and can use only those options specified in their own list for the assisted army&#39;s date, and any minima or maxima for upgrades are modified as above.&quot;_

If an external ally is specified in a list for the whole of that list&#39;s date range or for a specific date range where the allies available dates do not coincide then this is considered to be &quot;specified by either of the 2 lists&quot; and the ally can be used for the dates specified.

If the list being used and allies dates partially overlap then the ally can only be used when the date ranges overlap if no specific date range or exception is stated.

If the lists specified &quot;replace&quot; or similar instead of upgrades then this should be treated as an upgrade.

 
## &quot;0-1 per X&quot; form for allies

The form &quot;0-1 per X&quot; for eligibility of elements to be included in an allied contingent allows:

1. Values other than &quot;1&quot;, especially 0-2 for baggage,
2. &quot;X&quot; to be multiple elements such as Nikephorian skutatoi,
3. &quot;X&quot; may be a description, such as &quot;general&quot; or a specific troop type.
4. &quot;X&quot; must be some form of troop element, e.g. not a command.

An allied contingent may include troop defined by the form 0 - Y per X if X is also allowed in the allied contingent.

 
## &quot;0-1 per X troop type&quot; in main list

In some lists elements are described in the form &quot;0-1 per X troop type&quot;,. E.g. &quot;0-1 per 8 Reg Bd&quot; or &quot;0-1 per 6 Bw&quot;. This means for each per complete group of &quot;X&quot; taken then 1 element of that type can be used. Incomplete groups of &quot;X&quot; do not allow any elements so described to be taken. It is not necessary to take complete multiples of troop type X.


## Command size and baggage

A command of 10 elements can have 2 of these as elements of baggage and contribute these to the army baggage if allowed to do so.


## Sub-list allies and baggage

There are a number of allies specified specifically as sub-lists, e.g. Thai allies in Khmer and Cham and Ostmen allies in the Norse Irish list, of which some still have the &quot;indented&quot; form from previous versions. Unless otherwise stated, if a sub-list does not specify its own baggage then the ally can take baggage from the main list. If such baggage can be included in an army baggage command follows the normal rules.
