&quot;Only if Achaian after 208 BC or Athenian:

Upgrade Achaian or Athenian Cv (O) to Reg Kn (F) @ 31AP if C-in-C, 21AP if ally-general, otherwise 11AP                   All/0&quot;

This upgrade should also be applied to sub-generals at appropriate cost. (Historical and list error)

&quot;Aitolians in other states&#39; armies can be either mercenaries, or allies under their own general&quot; â€“ Only one of these can be used.
