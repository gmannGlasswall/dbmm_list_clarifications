## Principles used

The general principle underlying most of the list interpretations provided here is that the DBMM army lists should be played &quot;as written&quot;. There are three areas in which we make an exception to this principle:

- As DBMM is aimed at historical simulation we have used this as a basis for decisions where it is applicable, e.g. when there is a contradiction in the text. Where this is to be done that the interpretation given may not actually match the existing wording in some cases.
- Where perceived errors are found then the clarification may be a changed wording to the text. This is again done for historical accuracy.
- When addressing specific cases where Phil Barker has provided definitive clarification of his intention, despite the current wording of the lists.
- In the very few cases where there appears to be a genuine disagreement about the proper interpretation of the lists and to not have a common convention would undermine players&#39; enjoyment. In all such cases we clearly mark the text as a &quot;Suggested List Convention&quot;. All of these will hopefully be resolved by Phil Barker in the future, at which point the current convention will be replaced by the official ruling.

It is intended that this becomes a &quot;living document&quot; with periodic updates based on further debate, understanding or updates of the lists and rules, especially the input of Phil Barker on the DBMM List.


## Organisation of this Repository

This repository is arranged in sections corresponding to DBMM Army List Book numbers. There is also a general section to give guidance on issues that are applicable to many lists.
