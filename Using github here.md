# Guidance for those unfamiliar to GitHub

## What is GitHub
GitHub is an online collaboration tool mainly used by software developers to manage software code. It's a professional level tool and for personal use it is free. 

## What do I need to use it?
### Get a github account
If you want to make a contribution to this repository you will need to create a github account. It's free. It is stronly advised to add some form of 2 facotr authentication to your account for added security.

### Install github desktop.
Although you can just use the github website to make updates to files it's generally considered best practice to:

1. Make a local copy of the repository (clone the master).
2. Make the updates on the local copy.
3. Push the changes back to the repository.

There are command line tools (gitbash) that can do this but I've found the easiest tool to use is github desktop  - https://desktop.github.com/.

## How will my changes get updated to the main repository.
