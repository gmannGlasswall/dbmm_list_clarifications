# Introduction

![DBMM Front Cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76245811/103281751-9dd36e00-49cb-11eb-8dc4-5bc158a911d2.png)

The aim of this project is to create an updated set of list clarifications for the revised army Lists (2016 edition) for Phill Barker's DBMM Rules (Â©copyright for rules and lists belongs to Phil Barker). The secondary purpose is to collect list issues that fall outside the scope of clarifications in the hope that further improvmeents can be made to the lists some day. 

The purpose of the clarifications is to provide both players and list checkers a consistent framework in interpreting the DBMM Army List books. This document provides DBMM players and competition umpires with a guide to aid:

- Easing new players into using the lists with the answers to many frequently asked questions.
- Consistent interpretation of the list text, especially for competition play.

This document is not an &quot;official&quot; source of DBMM information but is released into the public domain in an effort to help sustain the growth of DBMM and enhance the enjoyment of DBMM players.

It is largely based on debates or queries that have occurred or are still taking place on the Groups IO DBMM List (https://groups.io/g/DBMMlist/topics) or in discussions between some of those who check lists for competitions.

This is not an official Wargames Research Group document and all copyright for the rules and army lists remains with Phil Barker.


## Scope

The focus of this document is on:

- Unclear or contradictory wording.
- Errors in the text that provide unhistorical results.
- Complex constructs and dependencies.
- Guidance for list checkers
- Some basic principles of DBMM lists such as the &quot;0-1 per x&quot; allocations of troops and sub-lists

This document currently covers the following lists:

1. DBMM ARMY LISTS. BOOK 1: 3000 BC to 500 BC
2. DBMM ARMY LISTS. BOOK 2: 500 BC to 476 AD
3. DBMM ARMY LISTS. BOOK 3: 476 AD to 1071 AD
4. DBMM ARMY LISTS. BOOK 4: 1071 AD to 1515 AD

This document does not provide details of all possible errata or mistakes. Where such may cause difficulties in interpretation we do provide guidance. (If you are interested in seeing the potential list issues identified look at [http://dbmmnotes.pbworks.com/](http://dbmmnotes.pbworks.com/).)
