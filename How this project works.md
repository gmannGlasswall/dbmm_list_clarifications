## Clarifications v List Issues
We've created 2 sections within this repository to create a new set of clarifications but also to capture list issues or suggestions in the hope that further list changes will happen one day. For guidane the differnce for the two is:

- Clarifications = How to use the lists as written.
- List Issues = Things that need to be altered within the lists.
