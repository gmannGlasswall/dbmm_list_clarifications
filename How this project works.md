# Guidance for this repository

## New to GitHub
A short guid on using github withing this porject can be found at https://github.com/gregmannuk/dbmm_list_clarifications/blob/main/Using%20github%20here.md.

## Clarifications v List Issues
We've created 2 sections within this repository to create a new set of clarifications but also to capture list issues or suggestions in the hope that further list changes will happen one day. For guidane the differnce for the two is:

- Clarifications = How to use the lists as written.
- List Issues = Things that need to be altered within the lists.


## How to Contribute to this project

### I've spotted a problem but don't have an answer for it
Create a new issue at https://github.com/gregmannuk/dbmm_list_clarifications/issues. This can then be picked up by another contributor and resolved by them.

### I've spotted a problem and have an answer for it
Make the change and submit it for approval via a pull request. We are using markdown for the documents on this sait (See guide at https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Please stick to the formatting style used.

## Change approval
The administrators of this site will approve the change/pull request if they think it is justified. For list clarification it must be a sensible interpretation of the wording. For list issues or changes it must be backed up a robust arguement. For both cases historical justification, with sources, is always preferred. Pull requests will be accepted, rejected or pushed back with comments.

## I've a lot of stuff I'd like to update
If you have changes to propose in a lot of different areas then split them up and make a number of smaller pull requests. It then makes it easier for the administrators to accept or reject individual changes. If you make one big set of proposals for changes and one is not acceptable they will all be rejected.
