# Book 3

## List 5 Middle Frankish

### Notes on when differnt option avaialble confusing
The notes on the heartland splitting in to Austrasia [A] and Neustria [N] in 1561 is confusing as it is not clear if the [N] or [A] options exists before this date. If they don't you can't actually make an army before 511 AD.


## List 37 Abbasid Arab

### Ahl Khurasan and other Arab lancer
These get upgraded, replaced, etc quite a few times so it is very difficult to work out what you can have at later dates. A simpler mechanism with specific date ranges for troops needs to be found.
