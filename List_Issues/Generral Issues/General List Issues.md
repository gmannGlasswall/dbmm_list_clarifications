# General issues

This section lists common list issues applicable to many army lists.

## &quot;0, or X-Y &quot; form for allies
In previous versions of the lists it was allowed to take troops listed as this as there was a specific provision in the rules for allied contingents. This provision was removed from the 2016 Revised edition lists but should be re-instated.
 
## Sub section syntax and ordering

### Syntax for sub sections
There is a variety of syntax used in the sub sections for all the lists. This shoud be standardised and the ordering of sections done consistently. The following syntax is proposed:

[From 9999 BC/AD] [Until 9999 BC/AD] [if condition] or
In 999 BC/AD [if condition]

Any section of the proposed syntax in [] is optional. Using &quot; until &quot; is a bit clunky but does provide a consistent wording whether part of a range or by itself.

### Sub section ordering
Ordering should be the following:

1. Any sub sections that span the entire list dates.
2. Sub sections in [From/In] date order 
3. Sub sections in [Until] date order

### Super groups
Within some lists there are major groupings or destinctions between differnt areas or political groupings that the above ordering will make it more difficult to use the lists, e.g Chinese Northern and Soouther Dynasties. This could be an indication that a list should be split but if not desired then creating a super group with a heading for each group of sub-sections will provide a more iuusable format.

## Sub lists
The removal of indented sub lists makes it difficult to know what is a sub list and what is not. Some form of formatting to indicate this is needed. Also many sub-lists do not get there own baggage but such contingents would have had bagagge. Some provision needs to be made for the by either including their baggage options in the sub list or allowing access to those from the main list.
