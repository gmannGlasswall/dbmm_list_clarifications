## List 13 – Medieval German

###Mounted crossbowmen should still be available after 1486 AD
The upgrade of crossbowmen to handgunners should be for foot only (Probable mistake as mounted crossbowmen mercenaries still existed at later dates).

###There should be an option to detach lighter armed troops from Feudal knights and ministeriales.
This happened at least once at the battle of Bouvines in 1214 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bouvines or J.F Veerbruggen - The Art if Warfare in Western Europe During the Middle Ages, pg 239). Suggest include a line with:

&quot;Detach lighter armoured seargents from Feudal Feudal knights and ministeriales as Reg Cv(O) @ 8AP		0-1&quot;

Needs further work to determine the range of dates this should be allowed.

###Battle of Marchfeld 1287
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_on_the_Marchfeld for summary.
This is essentially a battle between 2 Medieval Gerrman armies where the predominant troop type are horse archers. I'm assuming that this battle is the justification for Hungarian allies at this date. It's difficult to see how you can represent these 2 armies for a pivotal battle of the period using the current list.


## List 85 – Burgundian Ordonnance

### Dates for militia pikemmen/Lanksknechts
As the lanksknechts replace the militia pikement there are no Lanksknechts avaialable from 1507.
